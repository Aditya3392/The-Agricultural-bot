# The Agricultural Bot

**Project Overview:**

This project aims to build a semi-automatic seed sowing machine, named "The Agricultural Bot," designed to assist in sowing seeds accurately and efficiently within seedling trays. 

**Key Features:**

* **Semi-automatic:** Requires minimal user intervention for seed placement and tray movement.
* **Portable:** Compact and lightweight for easy transport and use in different locations.
* **Accurate Seeding:** Ensures precise seed placement at desired intervals and depths.
* **User-friendly:** Intuitive interface for setting parameters and operating the machine.
* **Budget-friendly:** Built within a budget range of Rs. 2000-3000 using readily available materials.
* **Sustainable:** Designed for extended operation (2-3 hours) with low power consumption.
* **Compact Design:** Dimensions of 50cm x 25cm x 10cm ensure easy storage and maneuverability.
* **Adjustable Speed:** Tray movement speed ranges from 2-10 km/hr for adapting to different seed types and user preferences.

**System Breakdown:**

* **Seed Hopper:** Stores seeds and dispenses them one by one onto the tray.
* **Seeding Mechanism:** Accurately positions seeds at designated intervals and depths.
* **Tray Transport System:** Moves the seedling tray smoothly and adjustably.
* **Control Unit:** Interfaces with the user and manages seed dispensing, tray movement, and other functionalities.
* **Power Source:** Battery-powered operation for portability and extended use.
